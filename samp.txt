                <p>The muscular system is a network of muscles in the human body that allows movement, maintains
                    posture,
                    and
                    produces heat. It works closely with the skeletal system to enable voluntary actions like walking,
                    running,
                    and lifting objects, as well as involuntary actions such as the beating of the heart and movement of
                    food
                    through the digestive tract. The muscular system is made up of three main types of muscles: skeletal
                    muscles
                    (voluntary, attached to bones), cardiac muscle (in the heart), and smooth muscles (in organs like
                    the
                    stomach and intestines). Overall, it is essential for body mobility, stability, and overall
                    function.
